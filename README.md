# haskell-library-template

This is the template I personally use for new Haskell libraries, it may not be right for anyone but me.

It includes the superset of all the common libraries I use since I generally find it easier to _remove_ libraries when I upload a package than continually add libs during development.

Feel free to use the template as a starter for your own template if you like.

It has a `hie` cradle so that haskell-language-server works with tests ðŸ˜„
